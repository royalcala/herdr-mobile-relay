# Stable Cloudflare tunnel setup

How to give one computer a permanent hostname and a background relay service
through a dedicated Cloudflare Tunnel. Read this only if you want the relay to
stay reachable without an open pane.

## When you need this page

Quick Start's temporary tunnel needs an open pane and gets a new hostname every
time. The stable path creates a dedicated tunnel on a domain you control,
installs a user service, and keeps the same hostname across restarts. It needs
a Cloudflare account with a domain added to it.

## Run the wizard

Add a domain to Cloudflare, then run:

```bash
herdr plugin action invoke install-service --plugin herdr-mobile-relay.events
```

The wizard ends by printing the private phone QR. Run it once per computer with
a distinct hostname, then add every QR to the same phone app.

The URL before `#setup=...` is the phone-app origin; it must stay identical on
every computer because installed-app identity and relay storage are
origin-scoped. The relay's own `wss://` hostname remains inside the private
fragment. On a new computer the wizard checks `https://herdr.<authorized-zone>`
for an existing Herdr app and uses it when found. In the setup menu, choose
**Choose Phone App and Show QR** to keep or change this origin. Use **Configure
App Deployment** only on the one computer that should publish app updates; its
configured deployment origin is authoritative and cannot be replaced by an
older relay-hosted app reconnecting in the background.
When a current origin is shown, option **1** keeps it. Option **2** deliberately
switches to this relay's hostname, and option **3** selects another app.

`cloudflared` login authorizes one zone at a time. The wizard reads and
preselects that domain from `~/.cloudflared/cert.pem`; choose **Sign in to
Cloudflare for another domain** to use Cloudflare's account-zone picker and
replace the active authorization. Manual domain entry remains available when
the certificate's zone cannot be resolved.

When it can read the authorized zone, the wizard refuses a hostname outside it
before creating a tunnel. Either way it compares the exact CNAME reported by
`cloudflared` with the requested hostname afterwards: the CLI can otherwise exit
successfully after silently appending its old zone. A prior affected run names
the stray record to delete, then resumes with the same tunnel once the correct
zone is authorized.

If `CLOUDFLARED_CONFIG` or `~/.cloudflared/config-herdr-mobile-relay.yml`
already exists, the wizard displays its tunnel, hostname, and public DNS status
before asking whether to reuse it. It does not adopt the config unattended;
`HERDR_STABLE_REUSE_CONFIG=1` is the explicit opt-in for automation.

## Useful actions

```bash
herdr plugin action invoke setup-link --plugin herdr-mobile-relay.events
herdr plugin action invoke change-hostname --plugin herdr-mobile-relay.events
herdr plugin action invoke status --plugin herdr-mobile-relay.events
herdr plugin action invoke configure-app-deploy --plugin herdr-mobile-relay.events
herdr plugin action invoke stable-teardown --plugin herdr-mobile-relay.events
herdr plugin action invoke uninstall --plugin herdr-mobile-relay.events
```

`setup-link` reprints the private phone QR and setup link. `status` reports the
current state. `configure-app-deploy` designates this stable relay as the
deployment owner for a separately hosted Cloudflare Pages app — see
[docs/updates.md](updates.md).

`change-hostname` moves the relay to another name — a new domain, say — by
routing it to the same tunnel and rewriting the ingress. The tunnel, its
credentials, and the relay token stay, so phones only need the new link, and
the old record keeps answering until you delete it in Cloudflare.

A tunnel's origin certificate covers one zone, and `cloudflared` turns a name
outside it into a subdomain of that zone: ask for `relay.new.example` and get
`relay.new.example.old.example`. Both stable setup and `change-hostname` read
the authorized zone when it is resolvable, refuse before creating the wrong
route, and offer to sign in for the right zone. The old certificate is retained
as a backup because routes in the previous zone may still need it. If the moved
hostname never answers its public health check, the previous local config is
restored.

## Teardown

Run `stable-teardown` before uninstall if its Cloudflare resources should also
be removed. After the explicit `teardown` confirmation, it removes the service,
tunnel, config, credentials, and matching local config pointer recorded in the
validated Herdr stable state. Historical `created_by_wizard` flags do not
authorize the operation: a relay previously adopted from an existing config is
still the configured relay and is removed. The state ownership marker, service
environment match, and Herdr tunnel-name namespace protect unrelated resources.
If an older teardown cleared state after preserving every resource, the action
can recover the teardown identity from the retained config. Recovery needs a
config whose `tunnel:` entry is a `herdr-mobile-relay-*` name, a loopback relay
origin on the configured port, a hostname, and credentials matching that tunnel;
otherwise it refuses without deleting anything.

`cloudflared` cannot dependably delete a DNS route. If the record remains,
teardown preserves its diagnostic state and names the exact record to remove
in the Cloudflare dashboard. Rerun teardown afterward to finish. Use
`change-hostname` instead when the tunnel should be retained under a new name.

Full uninstall removes the service, releases, relay state, push credentials, and
cache. It also removes the plugin registration when Herdr is reachable, and
prints the manual command when it is not.

## Relay logging

The relay defaults to the `info` log level, so routine inventory diagnostics at
`debug` are hidden. Put `HERDR_RELAY_LOG_LEVEL=debug` in the generated runtime
environment file to diagnose a service, then restore `info` when finished.
That file is the one named by `HERDR_RELAY_ENV` (normally managed by the
installer); an export in a terminal does not change an already-running service.
A custom `ExecStart=... serve` unit must set the variable through its own
`Environment=` or `EnvironmentFile=` arrangement rather than relying on the
plugin wrapper. For an installed unit, restart it after changing the file:
`systemctl --user restart <your-unit>`.

The installed unit is normally `herdr-mobile-relay.service`; substitute your
own name, such as `herdr-mobile-relay-ts.service`:

```bash
journalctl --user -u <your-unit> -p warning --since '1 hour ago' --no-pager
journalctl --user -u <your-unit> -f
journalctl --user -u <your-unit> -o json --since '5 minutes ago' --no-pager
```

On Linux, journal-connected relay stderr receives priorities automatically when
the unit keeps the default `SyslogLevelPrefix=yes`; terminal, file, and macOS
logs stay unprefixed. JSON controls formatting, not verbosity or journal
priority. The prefix sets the journal priority; slog attributes remain inside
`MESSAGE`, not separate journal fields. `-p warning` filters records displayed
by `journalctl`, while the log level controls records emitted and stored. `info`
still includes warnings, so this setting does not reduce repeated outage
warnings.

Inventory polling performs its first attempt immediately and keeps the normal
configured cadence (or the 15-second reconciliation cadence while the events
stream is healthy). If `agent.list` or `workspace.list` fails, automatic retries
back off exponentially from that healthy interval: each failed attempt doubles
the next delay, up to 60 seconds (a 2-second cadence becomes 4, 8, 16, 32,
then 60 seconds). A successful pair of required fetches resets the backoff and
restores the normal cadence. Every failed attempt remains a
WARN record; only the timing changes. Optional tab/pane fallback failures and a
stale topology commit do not count as upstream outage failures.

`Wake()` remains a coalesced, immediate refresh request even during backoff, so
an explicit phone refresh, successful relay action, topology change, or UDP
resync can cause an attempt sooner than the automatic retry. This is
intentional; connected phones also request a refresh every 120 seconds, and
multiple phones can interleave these automatic wakeups during an outage.
Wakeups are not blanket-rate-limited. The separate Herdr events-stream
reconnect loop is unchanged, so its unavailable/dropped warnings can still
appear at their existing cadence during an outage.

## Troubleshooting

- **No setup menu:** invoke the `setup` action:
  `herdr plugin action invoke setup --plugin herdr-mobile-relay.events`.
- **Stable setup stops:** keep its state and rerun the exact command printed.
- **Need the stable QR:** invoke the `setup-link` action.
- **Wrong zone appended to the hostname:** delete the stray record the wizard
  names, authorize the right zone, then rerun.

[QUICKSTART.md](../QUICKSTART.md) covers the failures shared with first-time
setup.

The QR imports the relay URL, label, and relay key, so treat the QR and setup
link as secrets.

## Serving another local service from the same tunnel

The relay's cloudflared can publish a second loopback service without a second
tunnel. Only `ingress` changes; the `tunnel:` and `credentials-file:` lines stay.

Two rules matter:

1. **Append the new rule after the relay's own rule and before the catch-all.**
   `read_cloudflared_relay_config` (the plugin's validator, used by
   `change-hostname` and the wizard) reads the *first* `hostname:`/`service:` it
   finds and requires it to be the relay's loopback origin on `HERDR_RELAY_PORT`.
   Reordering the block, or putting the new rule first, makes the wizard refuse
   the config. The catch-all `http_status:404` always stays last.
2. **Validate before restarting**, and preview the match with cloudflared's own
   resolver:

   ```bash
   CFG="$CLOUDFLARED_CONFIG"          # ~/.config/herdr/plugins/.../cloudflared/config.yml
   cp -a "$CFG" "$CFG.bak-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"   # always keep a dated backup
   cloudflared tunnel --config "$CFG" ingress validate
   cloudflared tunnel --config "$CFG" ingress rule https://relay.example.com/
   ```

   In cloudflared 2026.9.1 the ingress is **not** reloaded when the file changes
   (no reload record in the journal), so restart the unit — it runs the relay and
   cloudflared together, so the phone app blips for a few seconds:

   ```bash
   systemctl --user restart herdr-mobile-relay.service
   ```

**Hostname choice.** A tunnel only answers for names whose DNS record points at
*that* tunnel. The per-shard wildcards `*.sN.<zone>` belong to the **shard**
tunnels, so a name under one of them reaches the shard's cloudflared first and
gets its 404 — not this computer's tunnel. Two shapes work:

- a **single-label** name under the zone (sibling of `relay-laptop-rao.1us.work`);
  Universal SSL already covers `*.<zone>`, so no certificate work is needed;
- a name under a **shard wildcard**, backed by a **specific record that overrides
  the wildcard** (a less specific wildcard loses to the exact CNAME). TLS then
  comes from the shard's ACM certificate (`*.sN.<zone>`), which already exists.

Either way the record must be created from the machine that owns the tunnel, and
the name must also be in that computer's `ingress`.

**Never publish it bare.** remobi and similar tools have no login of their own.
Put Cloudflare Access in front first (account-level app + a policy allowing the
operator's email, which uses the One-Time PIN identity provider), then add the
DNS record, and only then load the ingress — in that order the hostname never
answers unauthenticated. Verify and revoke:

```bash
# Public request must ask Access (302 to <team>.cloudflareaccess.com), never
# serve the app; and the relay must not regress:
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code} %{redirect_url}\n' https://remobi.s1.1us.work/
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' https://relay-laptop-rao.1us.work/   # still 307
```

A public **404** instead of the Access redirect means the name is not routed to
this tunnel (usually a wildcard pointing at another one): check with
`cloudflared tunnel --config "$CFG" ingress rule <url>` and read the record back
from the DNS API.

Deleting the Access application (or its policy) **unprotects** the hostname
without stopping it — it would then serve the terminal to anyone. To take the
service down instead, delete the DNS record and the ingress rule.

To revert the whole change: restore the dated backup over `$CLOUDFLARED_CONFIG`
and restart the unit; the DNS record and Access app are independent and can be
left or deleted separately.
