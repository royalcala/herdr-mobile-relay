# Herdr gateway on @HOST@

Generated by `relay/gateway-deploy.sh`. Two containers: the Herdr gateway, bound
to loopback, and Caddy terminating TLS in front of it. The gateway holds no
secrets — it copies encrypted frames between a phone and a relay and cannot read
them — so this server only ever carries traffic.

@EMAIL_NOTE@

## Before you start

- A VPS with Docker and the compose plugin. 1 vCPU and 1–2 GB RAM is plenty; see
  `docs/gateway-self-hosting.md` in the repository for sizing and provider notes.
- A DNS `A` record (and `AAAA` if you have IPv6) for **@HOST@** pointing at it.
- Firewall: inbound **TCP 80 and 443** and inbound **UDP 3478** open, and
  **outbound UDP** allowed. Port 80 carries the ACME challenge, 443 carries
  everything phones do, UDP 3478 answers address discovery, and outbound UDP is
  what `POST /probe` sends so relays can test their own reachability.

UDP 3478 is worth opening even though nothing dials it directly. Two peers behind
NAT do not know the address the internet sees them at, so neither can tell the
other where to send packets; each asks this gateway, which answers with the
address it already observes, and the pair then connects directly instead of paying
for a relayed path through this server. It is published on the host rather than
proxied because raw UDP cannot travel through Caddy's TLS.

## Bring it up

Setup-menu action 3 (**Deploy or Upgrade Your Own WebRTC Gateway**) copies this
directory to the server over SSH, brings it up, and verifies it. These are the
same steps by hand:

```sh
# 1. from this computer
scp -r @BUNDLE@ root@@HOST@:/opt/herdr-gateway

# 2. on the server
cd /opt/herdr-gateway
docker compose up -d --build --force-recreate gateway caddy
```

The first `up` builds the gateway image from the `gateway-source/` directory in
this bundle, which takes a minute or two on a small server. Nothing is fetched
from GitHub, and no Go toolchain is needed on the server.

If the server runs `ufw`:

```sh
ufw allow 80/tcp
ufw allow 443/tcp
ufw allow 3478/udp
```

## Confirm it works

```sh
curl @HTTPS@/healthz
```

Expect JSON starting with `{"ok":true`. Until DNS resolves and the certificate
is issued this will fail; on the server itself, `curl
http://127.0.0.1:8443/healthz` answers immediately and proves the gateway is
running even before TLS is ready.

Logs:

```sh
docker compose logs -f --tail=50
```

## Point the relay at it

On the computer running the relay, open the plugin menu and choose **Choose
Connection Method → Your own gateway → I already run a gateway**, then enter:

```
@HOST@
```

The chooser checks `/healthz` before it saves anything, and writes
`HERDR_GATEWAY_URL=@WSS@` into the relay environment. Setting that variable by
hand does the same thing. Re-pair nothing: the relay key is unchanged by the
move, and the phone learns the new base from the next QR or setup link.

## Day-to-day

- **Change limits**: edit `.env`, then `docker compose up -d`.
- **Update the gateway**: `docker compose build --pull gateway && docker compose
  up -d`.
- **Quotas**: relayed-byte counters live on the `gateway-state` volume and
  survive restarts. Certificates live on `caddy-data`; keep it so renewals do
  not restart from scratch.
- **More regions**: gateways share no state. A second deployment with its own
  hostname is entirely independent, and each relay points at whichever one is
  closest.
